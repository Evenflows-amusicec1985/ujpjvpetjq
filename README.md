Oh man, just stumbled out of The Life List and my brain’s halfway lodged in another universe. Still got that sticky cola spot on my sneakers and bits of popcorn playing hide and seek in my hoodie pocket. What was I saying? Right, the movie – it’s this mishmash of crazy highs, like riding your bike down a hill that's too steep, and then - bam - emotional gut punches like someone swapped your protein shake with soy milk.

> So there’s this scene where, just as I was adjusting because the seat felt like sitting on a brick that's had its soul sucked out (who designs those things?), the protagonist’s at a crossroad, right? It’s like if Forrest Gump bumped into the Avengers but all he had was a map of feelings. Does that even make sense? Anyway, the director must’ve had a field day with their imagination, chucking plot twists around like confetti at a party where everyone’s forgotten how to dance.

And then there's this flashback, or was it a dream sequence? Reminded me of that time we tried doing yoga on the beach and the wind stole my mat. Random? Maybe. But it was just as disjointed yet somehow meaningful. The dialogue came in like earbuds tangling in your pocket; you think you’ve got it, then it slips past and leaves you grinning at your own confusion. 

> They almost lost me halfway through. Who could forget the scene with that cat (a metaphor or real, who could tell?) wandering like it’s got existential crises larger than my Monday vibes. Had me chuckling like an old engine trying to start on a winter morning. That lady shouting at the guy in front because he was texting – ironic, because isn’t it the new smoke signal for ‘I’m actually here but somewhere else’?

Someone—oh right, was it Johnny?—asked if they should download the movie or whatever. Uh, with this one, I’d say don’t. But also, you should. Watch the movie at home, slice of leftover pizza in hand, and let it marinate in your synapses. Or maybe skip it. I’m not even sure now. Brain’s too scrambled.

My back still aches from that seat, and the whole part where she... wait, no spoilers, but does anyone really wear socks like that in real life? Kind of like trying to enjoy a song but there's a saxophone solo in the middle that throws you through the mental windshield.

Was it good? Bad? I think it was both, like a perfectly imperfect planking session with too many interruptions.

}
```
